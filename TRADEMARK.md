### What IS allowed (Code - MIT License):
- Use, modify, and distribute the Dispatch Protocol software
- Fork the repository and build your own dispatch system
- Self-host for your fire department, EMS, or organization
- Contribute improvements back to the project
- Use the code commercially (the software is free)

### What is NOT allowed (Brand - Trademark Protected):

- Creating products/services that could cause brand confusion
- Using the llama mascots for commercial purposes

### Why This Matters

The code is **free forever** so every fire department can have modern dispatch software without vendor lock-in or predatory licensing.

The brand is **protected** so we can fund development through official merchandise sales, not VC money or private equity.

**frack predatory private equity.** This project stays independent.
