# SpaceOrBust

An open-source RPG that gamifies humanity's evolution into a multi-planetary, spacefaring civilization.

## Concept

SpaceOrBust blends real developer tools with civilization-building gameplay. Your actual GitHub contributions shape the evolution of humans, AI, and other biological life as they work together to expand across the solar system and beyond.

## Core Ideas

### Real GitHub Integration
- Commits, pull requests, and issues translate into in-game resources and progress
- Code contributions fuel technological advancement
- Collaboration multipliers reward open-source teamwork

### Hybrid Interface
- **CLI**: Terminal-based interface for "mission control" operations, resource management, and dev-style interactions
- **Web Dashboard**: Visual representation of your civilization, tech trees, and galactic expansion

### Three Evolutionary Paths
- **Humans**: Biological evolution, societal advancement, space adaptation
- **AI**: Digital intelligence emergence, consciousness evolution, human-AI cooperation
- **Bios**: Engineered life forms, terraforming organisms, symbiotic species

### Civilization Mechanics
- Research tech trees spanning centuries of advancement
- Manage resources across planets and space stations
- Balance cooperation and competition between factions
- Navigate existential risks and evolutionary bottlenecks

## Tech Stack

- **CLI**: Node.js / TypeScript
- **Web**: TBD (considering React, Svelte, or vanilla)
- **Backend**: TBD
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub API / Webhooks

## Status

Early development - defining core mechanics and architecture.

## Contributing
